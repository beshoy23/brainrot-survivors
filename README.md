# 🧟 Brainrot Survivors 🧟

> *When the internet memes become sentient and seek revenge, only YOU can survive the endless waves of cringe!*

## 🎮 What's This All About?

Ever wondered what would happen if all those brain-rotting memes came to life? Well, wonder no more! **Brainrot Survivors** is a Vampire Survivors-inspired roguelike where you battle endless hordes of internet memes, cursed TikToks, and weaponized cringe content!

### 🚀 Features That'll Melt Your Brain (In a Good Way)

- **🏃 Simple Controls, Deep Strategy**: Just WASD to move - that's it! But choosing where to move? That's where your big brain comes in!
- **⚔️ Auto-Attacking Weapons**: Your weapons handle the pew-pew while you handle the run-run
- **📈 Dopamine-Inducing Upgrades**: Level up and choose from randomized upgrades that'll make you go "just one more run"
- **🌊 Liquid Enemy Physics**: Enemies flow around each other like a cursed ocean of memes
- **💀 Tension & Release**: Dodge swarms → Collect XP → Level up → Feel powerful → Repeat until 3 AM

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (For My Fellow Nerds)

- **Engine**: Phaser 3 (because WebGL go brrr)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strictly typed, unlike my sleep schedule)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (hot reload faster than you can say "skill issue")
- **Architecture**: Entity Component System (ECS) - it's like LEGO for code!

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Move** with WASD/Arrow keys
2. **Survive** the meme apocalypse
3. **Collect** those shiny XP gems
4. **Choose** upgrades wisely when you level up
5. **Repeat** until your eyes bleed (please blink)
