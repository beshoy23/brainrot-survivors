# Brainrot Survivors Implementation Checklist

## ✅ Core Gameplay Loop

### 1. Primary Decision: Movement (Constant Tension)
- ✅ **Single input**: Movement only (WASD implemented)
- ✅ **Simple rule**: Don't touch enemies = don't take damage
- ✅ **Risk/Reward**: Navigate toward XP gems while avoiding enemies
- ✅ **Spatial puzzle**: Finding safe paths through enemy formations

### 2. Secondary Decision: Upgrades (Punctuated Release)
- ✅ **Level up**: Pause game, choose from 3-4 upgrade options
- ✅ **Build strategy**: Select weapons and passives that synergize
- ✅ **Power progression**: Feel stronger after each choice
- ⚠️ **Long-term planning**: Work toward weapon evolutions (basic weapons only)

## ✅ Tension-Release Cycle

### 1. TENSION BUILD-UP
- ✅ Dodge increasingly dense enemy swarms
- ✅ Collect XP gems under pressure
- ✅ Health depletes from mistakes
- ✅ Anxiety from being chased

### 2. RELEASE MOMENT
- ✅ Level up triggers pause
- ✅ Brief respite from action
- ✅ Strategic choice presented
- ✅ Anticipation of power increase

### 3. REWARD DELIVERY
- ✅ New weapon/upgrade acquired
- ✅ Immediate power spike felt
- ✅ Enemies die faster (damage/fire rate upgrades)
- ✅ Dopamine hit from progression

### 4. RETURN TO TENSION
- ✅ Enemies scale up in response (spawn rate increases)
- ✅ Density increases
- ✅ Back to survival pressure
- ✅ Cycle repeats

## ✅ Movement Mechanics

### Player Movement
- ✅ **Speed**: ~20% faster than basic enemies (200 vs 150)
- ✅ **Direction**: Equal speed in all directions (8-way movement)
- ✅ **Feel**: Responsive, no acceleration/deceleration
- ✅ **Purpose**: Just fast enough to escape, not fast enough to trivialize

### Enemy Movement
- ✅ **Basic pattern**: Direct path toward player
- ✅ **No pathfinding**: Straight line movement
- ✅ **Speed variety**: Fast (280), Basic (150), Tank (80), Swarm (170)
- ✅ **Predictability**: Simple AI makes player planning possible

## ✅ Enemy System

### Spawning
- ✅ **Location**: Off-screen edges
- ✅ **Timing**: Wave-based with increasing frequency
- ✅ **Density**: Gradually increases over time
- ✅ **Direction**: Spawns around player position

### Collision Rules
- ✅ **Enemy-to-Enemy**: NO COLLISION - enemies phase through each other
- ✅ **Enemy-to-Player**: Simple overlap detection causes damage
- ✅ **Benefits of no collision** implemented:
  - ✅ No traffic jams or safe spots
  - ✅ Unlimited enemy density possible
  - ✅ Smooth performance with object pooling
  - ✅ Creates "liquid" enemy flow

### Damage System
- ✅ **Contact damage**: Touching enemies drains health
- ✅ **Continuous damage**: Staying in contact = rapid health loss
- ✅ **No instant death**: Health buffer allows calculated risks
- ✅ **Recovery**: Possible if you escape quickly (invulnerability frames)

## ✅ Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **Object Pooling**: Pre-allocated enemies and projectiles
- ✅ **Spatial Grid**: Efficient collision detection
- ✅ **No complex physics**: Simple movement calculations
- ✅ **Sprite batching**: Using Phaser's built-in batching

### Code Quality
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Type safety implemented
- ✅ **Modular architecture**: Separate systems
- ✅ **Small files**: All files under 100 lines (except GameScene)
- ✅ **ECS pattern**: Separation of concerns
- ✅ **Modular Weapon System**: Behavior-based weapon patterns

## ✅ Core Features Completed
