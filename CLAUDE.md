# Brainrot Survivors Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A physics-based brawler game where players kick enemies into devastating chain reactions. **This is NOT a Vampire Survivors clone** - it's a unique physics combat experience built around knockback mechanics and enemy collision chains.

**Play the game**: https://beshoy23.github.io/brainrot-survivors/

*Automatically deploys on every push to master via GitHub Actions*

## Core Game Design

### Physics Brawler Mechanics
1. **Kick-Based Combat**
   - Single attack type: KICKS that launch enemies as projectiles
   - No traditional projectile weapons (arrows, bullets, etc.)
   - All damage comes from kicking enemies into each other
   - Chain reactions create exponential damage multipliers

2. **Enemy-as-Projectile System**
   - Kicked enemies become flying projectiles
   - Different enemy weight classes affect flight physics
   - Flying enemies can hit other enemies for chain damage
   - Dead enemies continue flying and can still cause damage

3. **Movement & Positioning**
   - Single input control (WASD/arrows only)
   - Player positioning critical for chain reaction setups
   - 8-directional movement with no acceleration
   - Spatial puzzle: position enemies for maximum chains

4. **Physics-Driven Progression**
   - XP gems drop from defeated enemies
   - Level-up triggers game pause with kick-focused upgrades
   - All upgrades enhance kick mechanics or physics behavior
   - NO traditional weapon unlocks

5. **Chain Reaction Gameplay Loop**
   - SETUP: Position enemies into dense groups
   - KICK: Launch first enemy into the group
   - CHAIN: Watch enemies collide and multiply damage
   - COMBO: Track consecutive hits with exponential multipliers

## Tech Stack

## Programming Best Practices

### Code Organization
1. **File Size**: Maximum 100 lines per file
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one clear purpose
3. **Modular Systems**: Separate systems that can be modified independently
4. **Configuration Files**: All game values in config files, not hardcoded

### Performance Requirements
1. **Object Pooling**: Pre-allocate ALL game objects (enemies, projectiles, effects)
2. **Spatial Grid**: Use for O(1) collision detection
3. **No Garbage Collection**: Reuse objects, never create/destroy during gameplay
4. **Target Performance**: 60 FPS with 200+ enemies on screen

### TypeScript Standards
1. **Strict Mode**: All strict checks enabled
2. **No Any Types**: Proper typing for all variables
3. **Interfaces**: Define clear contracts between systems
4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for classes/types
   - camelCase for functions/variables
   - UPPER_CASE for constants

### Code Quality
1. **No Long Functions**: Max 5 parameters per function
2. **Clear Names**: Descriptive, no abbreviations
3. **Comments**: Only for complex logic, code should be self-documenting
4. **Immutability**: Prefer immutable operations where possible

### Architecture Principles
1. **ECS Pattern**: Separate data (components) from logic (systems)
2. **Dependency Injection**: Systems receive dependencies, don't create them
3. **Event-Driven**: Use events for loose coupling between systems
4. **Data-Oriented**: Optimize for cache-friendly data access

### Development Workflow
1. **Hot Reload**: Use Vite's HMR for rapid iteration
2. **Debug Mode**: Visual overlays for collision boxes, spawn points
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track frame time, object counts
4. **Incremental Development**: Build features in small, testable chunks

## Key Design Decisions

### Why No Enemy Collision?
- Prevents pathfinding bottlenecks
- Allows unlimited enemy density
- Creates "liquid" enemy flow
- Massively improves performance
